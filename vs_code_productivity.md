## How Keyboard Shortcuts Improve Productivity

Keyboard shortcuts are essential for maximizing productivity in VS Code because they:

1. **Reduce Context Switching**: Keep your hands on the keyboard instead of reaching for the mouse
2. **Speed Up Workflow**: Execute commands instantly without navigating menus
3. **Maintain Flow State**: Avoid interruptions that break your coding concentration
4. **Reduce Repetitive Strain**: Minimize mouse movements and clicks
5. **Enable Advanced Features**: Access powerful features like multiple cursors efficiently

## Personal Experience: Terminal Commands in My Assignment Projects

During my assignment projects, I've found that the integrated terminal in VS Code has been incredibly valuable for my daily workflow. Here are the commands I use most frequently:

### **mkdir** - Creating Project Structure
I regularly use `mkdir` to create new folders for different components or features. For example, when building a React project, I'll quickly create directories like:
```bash
mkdir components
mkdir pages
mkdir utils
mkdir assets
```

### **cd** and **ls** - Navigation and Exploration
The `cd` command helps me navigate between different project directories, while `ls` gives me a quick overview of what files are in each folder. This is especially useful when working with complex project structures.

### **npm run dev** - Development Workflow
One of my most-used commands is `npm run dev` to start the development server. This command has saved me countless clicks and time compared to manually navigating to the terminal or using the mouse to run scripts.

### Real-World Time Savings
Just yesterday, while working on a project, I needed to create a new feature folder and start the dev server. Using the integrated terminal with these commands:
1. `mkdir new-feature` (2 seconds)
2. `cd new-feature` (1 second) 
3. `npm run dev` (2 seconds)

Total time: 5 seconds. If I had used the GUI, it would have taken at least 15-20 seconds with mouse navigation and menu clicking.

The **Ctrl + `** shortcut to toggle the terminal has become second nature to me, and I can't imagine coding without these terminal commands readily available in VS Code.
