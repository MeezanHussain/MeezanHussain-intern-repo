## Reflection on Professionalism at Focus Bear

### Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour

In a casual work environment like Focus Bear, professionalism is less about formality and more about respect and accountability. Professional behaviour includes being punctual to meetings, communicating clearly on Discord, contributing ideas, and handling feedback constructively. Unprofessional behaviour might look like ignoring messages, being dismissive in discussions, or coming unprepared to meetings.

### Respectful Communication in Remote Teams

Respectful communication means keeping tone polite and inclusive, even in short text messages. It also means actively listening during calls, clarifying disagreements calmly, and acknowledging teammates’ contributions. Constructive feedback should always be about actions or outcomes, not personalities.

### Giving and Receiving Feedback

When giving feedback, I’ll focus on the work, use specific examples, and suggest improvements. When receiving feedback, I’ll assume good intent, ask clarifying questions if needed, and avoid being defensive. This approach helps maintain trust and ensures feedback becomes a learning opportunity.

### Experiences with Great Teamwork

I’ve experienced teamwork that worked well when everyone was proactive, shared updates, and respected different perspectives. What made it effective was clarity of communication, accountability, and a supportive environment where people felt safe to ask questions.

### Steps for Clear, Respectful, and Inclusive Communication

* Share regular progress updates and blockers openly.
* Use team channels instead of relying solely on private messages.
* Be mindful of tone in written communication.
* Make sure everyone feels included in discussions, especially during group meetings.

### Creating a Positive Work Environment

I can help foster positivity by showing appreciation for teammates’ efforts, contributing ideas with enthusiasm, and bringing a sense of fun without compromising respect.

### Preparing for Meetings

To prepare effectively, I’ll review briefs, note down progress and blockers, and bring a clear agenda or questions. This shows initiative and keeps meetings focused.

### Being Proactive During Internship

Proactivity means not waiting for instructions—trying solutions first, sharing ideas, and escalating when truly necessary. If I need information or action from colleagues, I’ll follow up politely on Discord or email. If I don’t get a response after reasonable follow-ups, I’ll escalate to my supervisor, and in serious breaches of conduct, I’ll contact the CEO directly at the provided number.

### Things I Won’t Do

* Ignore or dismiss feedback.
* Come to meetings unprepared.
* Wait passively for tasks without taking initiative.
* Share confidential information or behave disrespectfully.
