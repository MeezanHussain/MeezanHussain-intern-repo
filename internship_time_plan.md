## **Focus Bear Time Tracking Strategy**

### **Current Setup**
- **App Installed**: ✅ Focus Bear installed and configured
- **Account Created**: ✅ Signed up and basic setup completed
- **Permission Issues**: ⚠️ Several UX/UI issues identified (see below)

### **Time Tracking Implementation**
- **Focus Sessions**: Start a focus session every time I begin work
- **Session Duration**: Match actual work time (25 min, 45 min, or custom)
- **Break Tracking**: Use built-in break reminders for movement breaks
- **Daily Logging**: Track all internship-related work time

### **Session Types to Track**
- **Development Work**: Frontend coding, debugging, testing
- **Team Meetings**: Stand-ups, retrospectives, planning sessions
- **Learning & Research**: Studying documentation, watching tutorials
- **Documentation**: Writing code comments, updating README files
- **Code Reviews**: Reviewing team code, providing feedback

## **Focus Bear Issues Identified & Workarounds**

### **1. Permission Blocking Confusion**
**Issue**: App shows "Blocking disabled: Permissions not granted" without clear guidance
**Workaround**: 
- Manually enable overlay permissions in phone settings
- Settings → Apps → Focus Bear → Permissions → Display over other apps
- Document the process for future reference

**Impact on Time Tracking**: May affect blocking features but not core time tracking

### **2. Unclear Stats Labels**
**Issue**: "High quality" vs "Low quality" screentime not explained
**Workaround**: 
- Focus on total time tracked rather than quality metrics
- Use focus session duration as primary time measurement
- Document actual work activities separately

**Impact on Time Tracking**: onfusing but doesn't prevent time logging

### **3. Onboarding Flow Break**
**Issue**: App gets stuck at "Overlay permission" step
**Workaround**: 
- Skip overlay permission setup initially
- Focus on core time tracking functionality
- Return to permissions later if needed

**Impact on Time Tracking**: Minimal - core tracking still works

### **4. Focus Session Setup Complexity**
**Issue**: "Super strict mode" and timer wheel not explained
**Workaround**: 
- Use default settings initially
- Experiment with different modes gradually
- Document what each setting does

**Impact on Time Tracking**: None - can still start and track sessions

### **5. Todos/Tasks UI Overload**
**Issue**: Multiple labels and advanced features overwhelm new users
**Workaround**: 
- Use simple task creation initially
- Focus on basic functionality
- Explore advanced features gradually

**Impact on Time Tracking**: None - task management separate from time tracking
