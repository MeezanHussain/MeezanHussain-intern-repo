# Cyber Security Guidelines: Learning & Reflection
*Milestone: Cyber Security at Focus Bear*

### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

**Remote Work Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks**: Public or home networks without proper encryption
- **Phishing Attacks**: Fake emails pretending to be from colleagues or company systems
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulation tactics to gain access to company information
- **Device Theft/Loss**: Laptops and phones left unattended in public spaces
- **Weak Authentication**: Simple passwords or no 2FA on work accounts
- **Malware Downloads**: Clicking suspicious links or downloading unsafe files

**Why Remote Work is Riskier:**
Working from home or public spaces means we're not protected by office security measures, making us more vulnerable to attacks that could compromise company data.

### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

**Device Security:**
- **Keep Software Updated**: Install security patches and updates promptly
- **Use Antivirus Software**: Protect against malware and viruses
- **Encrypt Your Data**: Use full-disk encryption on laptops and phones
- **Secure Your Network**: Use strong Wi-Fi passwords and WPA3 encryption
- **Lock Your Devices**: Set automatic lock timers and use strong passcodes

**Account Security:**
- **Unique Passwords**: Different password for each account
- **Password Managers**: Use tools like 1Password or Bitwarden
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA on all important accounts
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check account activity for suspicious behavior
- **Secure Recovery**: Set up secure recovery options for lost access

### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

**Physical Security Risks:**
- **Unauthorized Access**: Anyone can access your work files and company data
- **Data Theft**: Sensitive information can be copied or stolen
- **Account Hijacking**: Access to your logged-in work applications
- **Malware Installation**: Someone could install harmful software
- **Reputation Damage**: Your account could be used for malicious activities

**Real-World Scenario:**
Imagine leaving your computer unlocked at a coffee shop - a stranger could access your work email, company documents, or even transfer money if you have financial access. It's like leaving your house keys in the door!

### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

**Phishing Red Flags:**
- **Urgency**: "Act now or your account will be suspended!"
- **Suspicious Sender**: Email from unknown or spoofed addresses
- **Poor Grammar**: Obvious spelling and grammar mistakes
- **Suspicious Links**: Hover over links to see if they match the sender
- **Request for Sensitive Info**: Asking for passwords, credit card details, or personal data

**What to Do:**
- **Don't Click**: Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading attachments
- **Verify Sender**: Contact the person directly through known channels
- **Report It**: Forward phishing emails to your IT security team
- **Delete**: Remove suspicious emails from your inbox
- **Educate**: Share examples with colleagues to raise awareness

### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

**Strong Password Characteristics:**
- **Length**: At least 12 characters (longer is better)
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- **Uniqueness**: Different password for each account
- **Randomness**: Avoid personal information or common patterns
- **Unpredictability**: Don't use dictionary words or sequences

**Password Manager Benefits:**
- **Security**: Generates and stores complex, unique passwords
- **Convenience**: Auto-fills passwords across devices
- **Encryption**: Stores passwords securely with strong encryption
- **Breach Monitoring**: Alerts you if accounts are compromised
- **Easy Updates**: Change passwords regularly without memorizing them

### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

**2FA Security Benefits:**
- **Extra Protection**: Even if someone gets your password, they can't access your account
- **Breach Prevention**: Stops most automated attacks and credential stuffing
- **Account Recovery**: Easier to recover compromised accounts
- **Peace of Mind**: Know your accounts are much more secure

**When to Enable 2FA:**
- **Work Accounts**: Email, project management, company systems
- **Financial Accounts**: Banking, investment, payment platforms
- **Social Media**: Personal and professional social accounts
- **Cloud Storage**: Google Drive, Dropbox, company file systems
- **Any Account with Sensitive Data**: Health, legal, or personal information

## Reflection

### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

**Current Security Habits:**
- **Device Locking**: I lock my computer when stepping away (but sometimes forget)
- **Password Strength**: I use different passwords for important accounts
- **Software Updates**: I try to keep my devices updated regularly
- **Suspicious Email Awareness**: I'm cautious about unknown senders

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Password Manager**: I'm still memorizing passwords instead of using a manager
- **Auto-Lock Settings**: My devices could lock faster when I'm away
- **Security Education**: I could learn more about recognizing advanced threats

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

**Building Security Habits:**
- **Start Small**: Begin with one security practice and make it routine
- **Visual Reminders**: Use sticky notes or phone reminders for security tasks
- **Link to Existing Habits**: Connect security actions to things I already do daily
- **Track Progress**: Celebrate when I remember to lock my computer or use 2FA
- **Team Accountability**: Share security goals with colleagues for mutual support

**Making It Automatic:**
Security should become like brushing teeth - something I do without thinking. It's about creating routines that protect me and the company without feeling like extra work.

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Password Audit**: Review all my work accounts and identify weak passwords
- **2FA Setup**: Enable two-factor authentication on company systems first
- **Password Manager**: Research and set up a password manager this week
- **Account Review**: Check for any accounts I've forgotten about

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords every 3-6 months
- **Security Monitoring**: Check account activity weekly
- **Breach Alerts**: Sign up for breach notification services
- **Team Communication**: Share security best practices with colleagues

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

**Immediate Response:**
- **Don't Panic**: Stay calm and think through the situation
- **Change Password**: Immediately update the compromised account password
- **Enable 2FA**: If not already enabled, turn on two-factor authentication
- **Contact IT**: Report the incident to Focus Bear's security team
