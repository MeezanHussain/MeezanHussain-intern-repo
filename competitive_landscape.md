# Competitive Landscape — Focus Bear vs Freedom, Cold Turkey, Tiimo, Routinery

## TL;DR
Focus Bear mixes **habit routines** (morning/evening) with **focus sessions** and **distraction blocking**, aiming especially at AuDHD/ADHD users. Its differentiator is **AI-assisted blocking tied to your stated focus goal**, plus built-in routine coaching.

## At a glance

| App | Core job | What it’s great at | Trade-offs / gaps |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Focus Bear** | Guided routines + focus + blocking | AI site/app blocking aligned to your goal; habit routines before/after work | Mobile onboarding/permissions can be tricky; routines are time-of-day based (not fully custom yet). |
| **Freedom** | Cross-device website & app blocking | Reliable schedules + **Locked Mode** that prevents ending a session early | Less about routines/habits; more of a pure blocker. |
| **Cold Turkey** | Desktop-grade “unbreakable” blocking | **Frozen Turkey** can lock/log off/shut down your PC; strong weekly schedules | Desktop-centric; minimal habit/routine coaching. |
| **Tiimo** | Visual day planner for ADHD | Calendar-style planning, visual timers, Apple Watch & mobile support | Planner first; not a system-wide blocker. |
| **Routinery** | Routine timer & habit builder | Step-by-step routine flows with a dopamine “done” loop; Pomodoro option | Emphasis on routines; lighter on hard blocking. |

## What makes **Focus Bear** different?
- Combines **routines + focus timer + blocking** in one place (most tools do only one or two).  
- **AI-assisted blocking**: you write your intention and the app helps judge what’s relevant to allow/block.  
- Designed with **AuDHD/ADHD** users in mind, guiding you through morning/evening routines as well as deep-work sessions.

## If I were a user, why pick **Focus Bear**?
- I want **one app** that kicks off my day/evening routines *and* runs distraction-free work sprints.  
- I like that my **focus goal** influences what gets blocked (vs static blocklists only).  
- I need **phone-level blocking** while I work (not just a planner/timer).

## One feature competitors have that Focus Bear doesn’t (yet)
- **Hard “can’t-quit” lockdown** across devices during a block.  
  - Freedom’s **Locked Mode** makes it difficult/impossible to stop or edit a running session; Cold Turkey’s **Frozen Turkey** can even lock/log off/shut down a computer on schedule.  

*(Runner-up: Tiimo’s deep **wearable (Apple Watch) support** and visual day planning—useful for on-the-wrist prompts.)*

## One improvement Focus Bear could make
- **Add a true “Lockdown” mode + richer routine timing.**  
  Introduce an optional *can’t-quit* mode (with clear warnings) that mirrors Freedom/Cold Turkey toughness for high-stakes sessions, and expand routines beyond morning/evening to **custom time slots** (e.g., afternoon study block). This would keep Focus Bear’s unique routines + AI angle while matching the strongest block-integrity on the market.
