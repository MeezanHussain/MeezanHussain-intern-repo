**# Help-Seeking Strategy Reflection**

*## AI vs. Google*
I prefer using AI when I need quick feedback, debugging hints, or sample code snippets. AI helps me think through problems interactively, and is useful when I want explanations in plain language.  
I prefer Google when I need community-tested solutions, library-specific documentation, or to verify if others have faced the same error in real-world projects.

*## Asking Colleagues*
I ask colleagues when:
- The problem is tied to project-specific details.
- The issue involves sensitive code that should not be shared externally.
- I've already tried AI and Google but need deeper context or confirmation.

*## Personal Experience: University Database Project*
During my database management unit, I was building a web application with MySQL and PHP. I spent hours debugging a connection issue where my queries were returning empty results. I tried AI first, which suggested checking connection strings and SQL syntax - but the problem persisted. Google led me to similar issues, but none matched my specific setup. Finally, I reached out to my project partner who immediately spotted the issue: I was using the wrong database name in my connection string. This taught me that sometimes the simplest solutions are the ones you miss when working alone, and colleagues can provide that crucial "fresh pair of eyes" perspective.

*## Challenges in Troubleshooting Alone*
Developers often face challenges when working alone, such as:
- Wasting time going in circles without fresh perspective.
- Missing hidden project-specific details that only a colleague knows.
- Over-relying on a single source of help (e.g., AI hallucinations or outdated Google results).
- Struggling to judge when to escalate a problem instead of persisting too long.

By balancing AI, Google, and colleagues with a structured decision-making process, I can troubleshoot efficiently while learning and collaborating effectively.
