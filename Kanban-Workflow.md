# Agile Workflows & Kanban: Learning & Reflection
*Milestone: Agile at Focus Bear - Module 3*


### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

**Kanban Board Overview:**
A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps teams visualize their work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. It's based on the Japanese manufacturing system that uses visual signals to control production flow.

**How It Works:**
- **Visual Workflow**: Work items (tasks, stories, bugs) are represented as cards
- **Column-based System**: Cards move through different stages of the workflow
- **Pull-based System**: Team members pull work when they have capacity
- **Continuous Flow**: No fixed timeboxes - work flows continuously through the system

**Workflow Management Benefits:**
- **Visibility**: Everyone can see what's being worked on and where bottlenecks are
- **Flow Control**: Limits work-in-progress to prevent overload
- **Process Improvement**: Visual representation helps identify inefficiencies
- **Team Coordination**: Clear understanding of who's working on what
- **Priority Management**: Easy to see what needs attention next

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

**Standard Kanban Columns:**

**Backlog/To Do**
- **Purpose**: Work items waiting to be started
- **Content**: User stories, tasks, bugs that are prioritized but not yet in progress
- **Management**: Product Manager/Team Lead prioritizes and refines items

**In Progress**
- **Purpose**: Work currently being actively developed
- **Content**: Tasks that team members are actively working on
- **Management**: Developers update status and add blockers as needed

**Review/Testing**
- **Purpose**: Work completed but needing validation
- **Content**: Code ready for review, testing, or QA validation
- **Management**: QA team and code reviewers update status

**Done/Complete**
- **Purpose**: Work items that are fully completed and delivered
- **Content**: Features, fixes, or tasks that meet all acceptance criteria
- **Management**: Team confirms completion and moves to deployment

**Additional Common Columns:**

**Blocked**
- **Purpose**: Work items that cannot progress due to external dependencies
- **Content**: Tasks waiting for decisions, approvals, or external resources
- **Management**: Team identifies blockers and works to resolve them

**Deploy/Release**
- **Purpose**: Work ready for production deployment
- **Content**: Completed features waiting for release cycle
- **Management**: DevOps team manages deployment process

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

**Task Movement Process:**

**1. Backlog → In Progress**
- **Trigger**: Team member has capacity and pulls next priority item
- **Responsibility**: Developer who picks up the task
- **Action**: Move card to "In Progress" column and assign to self

**2. In Progress → Review/Testing**
- **Trigger**: Development work is complete
- **Responsibility**: Developer who completed the work
- **Action**: Move card to "Review" column and notify reviewers/QA

**3. Review/Testing → Done**
- **Trigger**: Code review and testing are complete
- **Responsibility**: QA team or code reviewer
- **Action**: Move card to "Done" column after validation

**4. Done → Deploy/Release**
- **Trigger**: Feature is ready for production
- **Responsibility**: DevOps team or release manager
- **Action**: Move card to "Deploy" column and manage release

**Responsibility Matrix:**
- **Developers**: Update task status, add blockers, move cards through development stages
- **QA Team**: Update testing status, move cards to Done after validation
- **Product Manager**: Prioritize backlog, refine user stories
- **Team Lead**: Monitor board health, identify bottlenecks
- **DevOps**: Manage deployment column and production releases

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

**WIP Limits Benefits:**

**1. Improved Flow**
- **Faster Delivery**: Fewer tasks in progress means faster completion
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Developers focus on fewer items at once
- **Better Quality**: More attention can be given to each task

**2. Bottleneck Identification**
- **Visual Clarity**: Easy to see where work is piling up
- **Process Improvement**: Teams can identify and fix workflow issues
- **Resource Allocation**: Better understanding of team capacity

**3. Team Productivity**
- **Reduced Overload**: Prevents team from taking on too much work
- **Sustainable Pace**: Maintains healthy work rhythm
- **Better Estimation**: More accurate predictions of delivery timelines

**4. Quality Improvement**
- **Thorough Completion**: Tasks are more likely to be fully completed
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Less rushed work means better code quality
- **Better Testing**: More time for proper validation

**5. Customer Satisfaction**
- **Predictable Delivery**: More consistent and reliable delivery
- **Faster Feedback**: Completed features reach users sooner
- **Better Prioritization**: Forces focus on highest-value work

## Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

**Priority Management:**
Kanban helps manage priorities through visual representation and WIP limits. By seeing all work items on the board, teams can easily identify what's most important and ensure high-priority items get attention first. The backlog column shows what's coming next, allowing for strategic planning.

**Overload Prevention:**
WIP limits are crucial for preventing overload. When a column reaches its limit, the team must complete existing work before starting new tasks. This creates a natural flow that prevents the team from becoming overwhelmed and ensures sustainable productivity.

**Visual Workload Management:**
The board makes it easy to see when someone has too many tasks assigned or when work is piling up in certain areas. This visibility helps team leads and members identify overload situations early and redistribute work appropriately.

**Continuous Flow:**
Unlike time-boxed approaches, Kanban's continuous flow allows teams to maintain steady progress without the pressure of artificial deadlines. This reduces stress and prevents the "crunch time" that often leads to overload.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

**Personal Workflow Improvements:**

**1. Visual Task Management**
- **Personal Kanban**: Use a simple board (even sticky notes) to track my tasks
- **Status Visibility**: Always know what I'm working on and what's next
- **Progress Tracking**: See how work flows through different stages

**2. WIP Limits for Myself**
- **Limit Active Tasks**: Work on maximum 2-3 frontend tasks at once
- **Focus on Completion**: Finish one task before starting another
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Give each task proper attention

**3. Blocked Task Management**
- **Identify Blockers Early**: Flag tasks that can't progress due to dependencies
- **Seek Help Promptly**: Don't let blocked tasks sit idle
- **Document Dependencies**: Clear communication about what's needed

**4. Continuous Improvement**
- **Regular Reflection**: Review my workflow weekly to identify improvements
- **Process Adaptation**: Adjust my approach based on what works best
- **Team Feedback**: Learn from how others manage their workflow

**5. Communication Enhancement**
- **Status Updates**: Keep team informed about my progress
- **Blocker Communication**: Immediately notify team when I'm blocked
- **Capacity Planning**: Realistic estimates about what I can take on

## Task

### Check out Focus Bear's Kanban board and note how tasks are structured

**Focus Bear's Kanban Board Analysis:**

I've reviewed Focus Bear's Kanban board from the screenshot (`screenshots/Kanban-Board.png`) and the GitHub Projects link: [https://github.com/users/MeezanHussain/projects/1](https://github.com/users/MeezanHussain/projects/1)

**Board Structure Observations:**

**Column Organization:**
- **Backlog**: Contains prioritized user stories and tasks waiting to be started
- **In Progress**: Shows active development work with assigned team members
- **Review**: Tasks completed and ready for code review or testing
- **Done**: Completed work items that meet acceptance criteria

**Task Structure:**
- **User Stories**: Written in "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]" format
- **Task Cards**: Include assignees, labels for priority/type, and acceptance criteria
- **Visual Indicators**: Color coding for different task types and priorities
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear status updates and blocker identification

**Workflow Patterns:**
- **Pull-based System**: Team members pull work when they have capacity
- **Visual Dependencies**: Clear indication of task relationships
- **Continuous Flow**: No fixed timeboxes, work moves as capacity allows

### Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly

**Task Movement Example:**

**Task**: "Implement responsive navigation menu for mobile devices"

**Movement Process:**
1. **Backlog → In Progress**
   - Picked up the task when I had capacity
   - Updated status to "In Progress"
   - Assigned to myself
   - Added start date and estimated completion

2. **In Progress → Review**
   - Completed the responsive navigation implementation
   - Added testing notes and screenshots
   - Moved card to "Review" column
   - Notified team for code review

3. **Review → Done**
   - Code review completed successfully
   - Mobile testing passed on multiple devices
   - Moved card to "Done" column
   - Added final notes and deployment readiness

**Status Update Best Practices:**
- **Immediate Updates**: Update status as soon as work progresses
- **Clear Communication**: Add notes about what was completed
- **Blocker Documentation**: Flag any issues that prevent progress
- **Progress Notes**: Keep team informed about current status

### Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role

**Improvement Area: Enhanced Task Documentation**

**Current State:**
Basic task updates with minimal context about progress and decisions made during development.

**Proposed Improvement:**
Implement a more detailed task tracking approach that includes:

**1. Development Notes**
- **Technical Decisions**: Document why certain approaches were chosen
- **Code Changes**: Brief summary of major modifications made
- **Dependencies**: Note any external libraries or API changes needed

**2. Progress Milestones**
- **Sub-task Completion**: Break large tasks into smaller milestones
- **Testing Status**: Track unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing
- **Review Status**: Document code review feedback and resolutions

**3. Blocker Resolution**
- **Issue Description**: Clear explanation of what's blocking progress
- **Resolution Steps**: Document how blockers were resolved
- **Prevention**: Note how similar issues can be avoided in future
