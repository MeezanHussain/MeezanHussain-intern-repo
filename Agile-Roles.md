### How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

#### **Scrum Collaboration**
- **Structured Meetings**: Daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives with defined roles
- **Role Boundaries**: Clear separation of responsibilities (PO owns backlog, SM facilitates)
- **Commitment-based**: Team commits to work for fixed sprint duration
- **Ceremony-driven**: Regular meetings ensure collaboration and alignment

#### **Kanban Collaboration**
- **Continuous Flow**: Roles collaborate as work moves through the system
- **Flexible Interaction**: Less formal structure, more ad-hoc collaboration
- **Pull-based**: Roles pull work when they have capacity
- **Visual Management**: Kanban board shows work status and bottlenecks
- **Just-in-time**: Collaboration happens when needed, not on a schedule

**Key Differences:**
- **Scrum**: More structured collaboration through ceremonies
- **Kanban**: More flexible, continuous collaboration
- **Scrum**: Role responsibilities are more rigidly defined
- **Kanban**: Roles can adapt and overlap more easily

## Reflection

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

**My Role: Frontend Developer Intern at Focus Bear**

As a frontend developer intern, I contribute to the Agile process in several key ways:

**Technical Contribution:**
- **Code Development**: Building user interfaces and implementing frontend features
- **Quality Assurance**: Writing clean, maintainable code and participating in code reviews
- **Technical Estimation**: Providing effort estimates for frontend-related user stories
- **Problem Solving**: Collaborating with the team to find technical solutions

**Agile Process Contribution:**
- **Sprint Participation**: Committing to and completing frontend work within iterations
- **Daily Collaboration**: Participating in standups to report progress and blockers
- **Story Refinement**: Contributing technical insights during user story discussions
- **Continuous Learning**: Embracing Agile principles of adaptation and improvement

**Team Collaboration:**
- **Cross-functional Communication**: Working with designers, backend developers, and QA
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Learning from experienced team members and sharing my insights
- **Process Improvement**: Contributing ideas during retrospectives for team improvement

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

**Overlap with QA:**
- **Testing Collaboration**: I need to ensure my code is testable and provide context for testing
- **Bug Resolution**: Working together to reproduce and fix frontend-related issues
- **Quality Standards**: Aligning on what constitutes "done" for frontend features

**Overlap with UX/UI Designers:**
- **Design Implementation**: Converting designs into functional code
- **Technical Constraints**: Communicating what's technically feasible vs. challenging
- **User Experience**: Ensuring the implemented solution matches the intended design

**Overlap with Backend Developers:**
- **API Integration**: Collaborating on data flow and interface contracts
- **Data Handling**: Ensuring frontend properly handles backend responses and errors
- **Performance**: Working together on optimization and loading strategies

**Overlap with Product Manager:**
- **Requirement Clarification**: Understanding user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Technical Feasibility**: Providing input on what's possible within time constraints
- **User Impact**: Understanding how technical decisions affect user experience

## Task

### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

**Frontend Developer Intern in the Agile Team**

As a frontend developer intern, I'm a key contributor to the development team's ability to deliver user-facing features. My role bridges the gap between design vision and technical implementation, ensuring that user stories become working, interactive interfaces.

I fit into the Agile team by:
- **Delivering Value**: Converting user stories into functional frontend components
- **Collaborating Continuously**: Working closely with designers, backend developers, and QA throughout the development process
- **Adapting Quickly**: Embracing changing requirements and technical challenges as they arise
- **Learning and Growing**: Contributing fresh perspectives while learning from experienced team members
- **Maintaining Quality**: Writing clean, maintainable code that supports the team's sustainable pace

My role is essential because users interact directly with what I build, making frontend development critical to the overall user experience and product success.

### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

**Role: UX/UI Designer**

**Current Collaboration:**
I work closely with designers to implement their vision into functional code, ensuring the final product matches the intended user experience.

**How I Can Improve Teamwork:**

**1. Early Involvement:**
- Participate in design discussions before implementation begins
- Ask clarifying questions about design decisions and user goals
- Provide early feedback on technical feasibility

**2. Better Communication:**
- Use design tools (Figma, Sketch) to better understand design specifications
- Document technical constraints that might affect design implementation
- Share progress updates with designers to ensure alignment

**3. Collaborative Problem-Solving:**
- Work together to find solutions when design requirements conflict with technical constraints
- Involve designers in technical decisions that affect user experience
- Collaborate on responsive design and accessibility considerations

**4. Knowledge Sharing:**
- Learn more about design principles and user experience best practices
- Share technical insights that could inform design decisions
- Create a shared understanding of frontend capabilities and limitations

**5. Feedback Loop:**
- Provide constructive feedback on design feasibility and implementation challenges
- Request design reviews of implemented features to ensure quality
- Collaborate on design iterations based on technical implementation insights

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Faster design-to-code handoffs
- Better alignment between design vision and technical implementation
- Improved user experience through closer collaboration
- Reduced rework and design changes during development
- Stronger working relationship and mutual understanding
