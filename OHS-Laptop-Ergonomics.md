# Occupational Health & Safety: Laptop Ergonomics
*Milestone: Company Policies - OHS for Desk-Based Work at Focus Bear*

### What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?

**Primary Health Risks:**

**Neck and Shoulder Strain:**
- **Hunched Posture**: Looking down at laptop screen forces neck into forward position
- **Shoulder Tension**: Arms raised to reach laptop keyboard cause shoulder muscle strain
- **Forward Head Position**: Can lead to "text neck" and chronic pain

**Wrist and Hand Issues:**
- **Carpal Tunnel Risk**: Laptop keyboards force wrists into awkward angles
- **Repetitive Strain**: Small laptop keys increase typing effort and strain
- **Poor Wrist Support**: No palm rest leads to wrist extension and discomfort

**Eye Strain and Vision Problems:**
- **Screen Too Close**: Laptop screens are typically too close to eyes
- **Poor Viewing Angle**: Looking down causes eye fatigue and dryness
- **Inadequate Screen Size**: Small screens force squinting and close focus

**Long-term Consequences:**
- **Chronic Pain**: Persistent neck, shoulder, and wrist discomfort
- **Reduced Productivity**: Pain and discomfort decrease work efficiency
- **Injury Risk**: Repetitive strain injuries can become permanent

### What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop?
