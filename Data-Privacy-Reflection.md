## Task

### Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role

**Security Habit: "Privacy-First Code Review"**

**What I'll Do:**
Before submitting any code for review, I'll conduct a privacy and security self-check to ensure I'm not accidentally exposing sensitive data.

**Specific Checklist:**
- **No Hardcoded Data**: Check for API keys, passwords, or user data in code
- **Secure Defaults**: Ensure security features are enabled by default
- **Data Validation**: Verify input validation prevents data injection
- **Error Handling**: Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Confirm proper authentication and authorization checks

**Implementation:**
- **Pre-commit Review**: Run this checklist before every code commit
- **Documentation**: Keep a log of security checks performed
- **Team Sharing**: Share this practice with other developers
- **Continuous Learning**: Update checklist based on new security threats

### Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement

**Key Learning: "Data Classification Awareness"**

**What I Learned:**
Understanding the different levels of data sensitivity at Focus Bear helps me make better decisions about how to handle information in my daily work.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Learn Classifications**: Understand what data is public, internal, confidential, or restricted
2. **Apply to Work**: Use appropriate security measures based on data sensitivity
