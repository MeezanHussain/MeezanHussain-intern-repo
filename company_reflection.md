# Focus Bear – Reflection

1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Focus Bear was created by a neurodivergent team—people with ADHD and ASD—who couldn’t find productivity tools that suited their unique needs. They built the app to help AuDHDers build healthy routines, reduce distractions, and support executive functioning.

2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?
The app tackles several challenges: difficulty focusing, impulsivity, and trouble establishing and maintaining routines. It blocks distracting websites and apps, guides users through morning habits, and helps with punctuality using features like “Late No More.” 

3. Why is this mission important?
People with ADHD and ASD often experience reduced productivity, struggle with employment, and face higher unemployment rates. By improving routines, focus, and time‑management, Focus Bear supports wellbeing and inclusion.

4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
As someone with ADHD, I value tools that understand my brain not the other way around. Focus Bear’s empathy-driven design matches my belief that productivity solutions should be inclusive, accessible, and rooted in lived experience.

5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Absolutely. I’ve experienced chronic distraction, impulsivity, and burnout. I’ve struggled to stick to a morning routine because I’d get lost in email or social media.

- **After downloading Focus Bear**, I set up a custom morning routine with exercise and mindfulness.
- The app nudges me away from distractions, blocks irrelevant apps, and helps me stay punctual with work and uni obligations.
- Gradually, I’ve noticed my focus improving, my mornings getting smoother, and my overall productivity feel more doable.
